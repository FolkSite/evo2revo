# Evo2Revo
Evo2Revo provides the tool to help you in your migration from MODX Evolution to MODX Revolution.<br/>
In the past to migrate one MODX site to a new MODX install, some MODX/PHP/MySQL experience would be necessary. A series of export/import sql tasks were required and depending on the version of MODX, may or may not be quite as simple as that.
# Usage #
* Copy MODX Evolution website with database.
* Install empty MODX Revolution to the same database
* Setup evo2revo ($config)
* Run
